    <p>Working at the intersection of
        communications and technology, Joel Inwood is a public relations and
        communications professional, writer and storyteller. His diverse work involves
        forging connections of all kinds: facilitating communication across disparate
        parts of a system, breaking down complex scientific and technological
        information for the general public and delivering impactful public relations
        campaigns on behalf of large organizations. His open-minded approach combines
        technical writing expertise with creative adaptability, and he often serves as a
        bridge connecting people with different perspectives and backgrounds.</p>

    <p>Joel grew up in a log cabin on a
        farm at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains, where he developed an
        appreciation for necessary, day-to-day work and a love for nature’s simple
        beauty. In high school, he wrote for the student newspaper, helping develop the
        paper’s first online edition. While at
        <a href="https://www2.gmu.edu/" target="_blank">George Mason University</a>,
        he studied Spanish in Buenos Aires and graduated the following
        year with a B.A. in Global Affairs and a Spanish minor. Increasingly interested
        in telling global stories, Joel moved to Panama City after college and interned
        with <a href="https://www.thepanamanews.com/" target="_blank">The Panama News</a>,
        reporting on the mass protests erupting in the wake of changes to the nation’s
        social security laws. In 2006, Joel joined the team at Guatemalan nonprofit
        <a href="https://www.puebloapueblo.org/" target="_blank">Pueblo a Pueblo</a>,
        where he created public relations initiatives to rebuild a
        local hospital destroyed by a devastating mudslide. His work with PaP included
        organizing events, blogging, and fundraising, and he remained as a volunteer on
        the board for several years.</p>

<p>From 2007 to 2012, Joel worked as an
Editorial Assistant at the <a href="https://www.agu.org/" target="_blank">American 
Geophysical Union</a>’s 
<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/21699402">Journal of 
Geophysical Research: Space Physics</a>, honing his editing skills by working 
with researchers to perfect texts for publication. He quickly became the 
department’s tech expert, teaching himself the 
<a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX markup language</a> through trial 
and error along the way. Inspired by the science but missing the social justice 
aspects of journalism, Joel returned to school in 2009 to earn his Masters in
Communications at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins 
University</a>’s D.C. campus. “I’d studied and worked in journalism in the past, 
but I was fascinated by the comms side of the equation: thinking about how people 
respond to writing, thinking about the different ways of communicating messages, 
and how the medium affects—or is—the message. It felt like time to bolster my 
interest in the philosophy of communications with more practical, technical 
knowledge of the field.” Joel moved to Chicago in 2013 and took a job as Manager of Public Relations and
Publications for <a href="https://www.eastwest.edu" target="_blank">East-West 
University</a>, where he managed official communications with students as well 
as the university's PR needs. He also served as a Deputy Managing Editor for the 
university's journal, East-West Affairs, and volunteered as a writing tutor.</p>

<p>Shortly after moving to Chicago, Joel discovered 
<a href="https://chihacknight.org" target="_blank">Chi Hack Night</a>, a free 
weekly event where Chicagoans build, share, and learn about civic technology 
tools to serve the public good. Inspired by the community and mission, he led 
a breakout group in creating an interactive map to assess the quality of 
different nursing homes in the area. Next, he helped transform the informal 
gathering into an official nonprofit. In 2020, Joel joined the Chi Hack Night 
Board of Directors, where he currently leads the Event Operations team. “People 
don’t always see the potential connection between social justice and technology. 
But there are so many ways technology can support public needs and interests. 
I like opening people’s eyes to those possibilities. We need more collaboration 
between government, nonprofits, and the tech world.”</p>

<p>In 2015 Joel became a Public Information Officer for Cook County’s Bureau of
Technology, a role that requires a range of behind-the-scenes technical and
public-facing communication skills. During the COVID-19 crisis, Joel
collaborated with the Department of Public Health to share vital information with
local residents via social media. He’s also part of the Cook County Racial
Equity Core Team, and helps maintain 
<a href="https://www.cookcountyil.gov" target="_blank">the county website</a>, 
overseeing content and troubleshooting technical issues. In 2023 Joel was promoted to Deputy Director of Communications.</p>
