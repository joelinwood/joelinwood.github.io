<h1>Joel Inwood</h1>

<p>Working at the intersection of
communications and technology, Joel Inwood is a public relations and
communications professional, writer, and storyteller. His diverse work involves
forging connections of all kinds: facilitating communication across disparate
parts of a system, breaking down complex scientific and technological
information for the general public, and delivering impactful public relations
campaigns on behalf of large organizations. His open-minded approach combines
technical writing expertise with creative adaptability and he often serves as a
bridge connecting people with different perspectives and backgrounds.</p>


<p>Joel grew up in a log cabin on a
farm at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains, where he developed an
appreciation for necessary, day-to-day work and a love for nature’s simple
beauty. In high school he wrote for the
student newspaper, helping develop the paper’s first online edition-- the first
step in a long career merging humanity and technology. While at George Mason
University, he studied Spanish in Buenos Aires, and graduated the following
year with a B.A. in Global Affairs and a Spanish minor. Increasingly interested
in telling global stories, Joel moved to Panama City after college and interned
with <a href="https://www.thepanamanews.com/">The Panama News</a>,
reporting on the mass protests erupting in the wake of changes to the nation’s
social security laws. In 2006 Joel joined the team at Guatemalan nonprofit 
<a href="https://www.puebloapueblo.org/">Pueblo a Pueblo</a>, where he created 
public relations initiatives to rebuild a
local hospital and surrounding neighborhood destroyed by a devastating
mudslide. His work with PaP included organizing
events, blogging, and fundraising, and he remained as a volunteer on the board
for several years.</p>

<p>From 2007 to 2012, Joel worked as an
Editorial Assistant at the American Geophysical Union’s Journal of Geophysical
Research: Space Physics, honing his editing skills by working with researchers
to perfect texts for publication. He quickly became the department’s tech expert,
teaching himself to code and learning the nuances of the LaTeX markup language
along the way. Inspired by the science but missing the social justice aspects
of journalism, Joel returned to school in 2009 to earn his Masters in
Communications at Johns Hopkins University’s D.C. campus. “I’d studied and
worked in journalism in the past, but I was fascinated by the comms side of the
equation: thinking about how people respond to writing, thinking about the
different ways of communicating messages, and how the medium affects—or is—the
message. It felt like time to bolster my interest in the philosophy of
communications with more practical, technical knowledge of the field.” While in
D.C., Joel met and married the love of his life, Beth Windisch, and the pair
moved to Chicago in 2013. Joel took a job as Manager of Public Relations and
Publications for East-West University, where he managed official communications
with students as well as the university's PR needs. He also served as a Deputy Managing Editor
for the university's journal, East-West Affairs, and volunteered as a writing
tutor.</p>

<p>Shortly after moving to Chicago,
Joel discovered Chi Hack Night, a free weekly event where Chicagoans build,
share, and learn about civic technology tools to serve the public good.
Inspired by the community and mission, he led a breakout group in creating an
interactive map to assess the quality of different nursing homes in the area.
Next, he helped transform the informal gathering into an official nonprofit. In
2020, Joel joined the Chi Hack Night Board of Directors, where he currently
leads the Event Operations team. “People don’t always see the potential
connection between social justice and technology. But there are so many ways
technology can support public needs and interests. I like opening people’s eyes
to those possibilities. We need more collaboration between government,
nonprofits, and the tech world.”</p>

<p>In 2015 Joel began his current
position as the Public Information Officer for Cook County’s Bureau of
Technology, a role that requires a range of behind-the-scenes technical and
public-facing communication skills. During the COVID-19 crisis, Joel
collaborated with the Department of Public Health to share vital information with
local residents via social media. He’s also part of the Cook County Racial
Equity Core Team, serves as Co-chair of the Racial Equity Data and Outcomes
Team, and helps maintain the county website (cookcountyil.gov), overseeing
content and troubleshooting technical issues.</p>
