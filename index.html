<h2>Promoting Myself</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>By day, I'm a Public Information Officer for the Cook County Bureau of Technology. The main <target="_blank" a href="https://cookcountyil.gov">County Website</a> is built in Drupal. I help manage the site and CMS. From time to time, I work on special projects requiring customization.</li>
<li>By night, I'm the <a target="_blank" href="https://chihacknight.org">Chi Hack Night</a> "Nursing Home Guy." Some frinds and I ran a breakout group that built <a target="_blank" href="http://chicagonursinghomesearch.com">Chicago Nursing Home Search</a>.</li>
<li>Prior to all that, I did a bunch of other things. Because I'm old. Here's my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-inwood-18645512/">LinkedIn</a>. That will take you all the way back to my barista days.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>I'm looking for new projects to get involved with at Hack Night or elsewhere. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
