I decided to build myself a nice, clean portfolio site. 
## Promoting Myself
* I'm a Public Information Officer for the Cook County Bureau of Technology. The main [County Website](https://cookcountyil.gov) is built in Drupal. I help manage the site and CMS. From time to time, I work on special projects requiring custom work.
* At [Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org) some frinds and I ran a breakout group that built [Chicago Nursing Home Search](http://chicagonursinghomesearch.com). Here's the [repo](https://github.com/open-retirement/open-retirement.github.com).
